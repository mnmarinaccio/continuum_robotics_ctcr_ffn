# continuum_robotics_ctcr_ffn
Analysis of Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) on the first publicly available Concentric Tube Continuum Robotics (CTCR) dataset. This project explores preprocessing techniques, loss functions, activation functions, batch sizes, and architectures, comparing their performance on translational and rotational error metrics.
